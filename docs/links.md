## React Native

- React Native network requests https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html

- React native boilerplate https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app

- https://hackernoon.com/manage-react-native-project-folder-structure-and-simplify-the-code-c98da77ef792

- Failed to open development menu in React for triggering hot reloading until I found this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32914665/how-do-i-shake-an-android-device-within-the-android-emulator-to-bring-up-the-d (open by terminal command adb shell input keyevent 82)

- Kind of got this one running, provides some basic components and a nice TODO-list. Not much explained, but the code itself gives a nice level2-view of how one can work with React: https://hellokoding.com/todo-app-with-react-native/
